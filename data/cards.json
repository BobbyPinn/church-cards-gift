        "description":  "I believe this one you drew the nice little heart on it first, then reminded me on the back the day of our anniversary, because I am very forgetful I suppose. The first couple pictures were from when I was picking out the right flowers t oask you out. The fourth is likely me confirming with Ava that the candy haul would satisfy you. Shortly after that last picture was taken in the car ava called me and her dad said 'well since Kylies basically my daughter what are your intentions with Kylie?'. Nervous, I responded, 'To spend time with her and make her happy'. The photo of the coupons I made for you was taken at 4:20 in the morning :,). The rest are from our anniversary day! Pretty sure the photos of you in the car were because you were hangry and there was traffic. Then you are seen eating a crumbl cookie. I love you so much.",

Yellow was happy orange wasanzious dark blue was neutral? IDK it was something like that. I cant seem to remember what the red part is suppodes to represent, perhaps anger because I always piss you off? Anyways I really like this piece its very abstract and artsy. I think the idea behind combining your emotion into art in the physical world. I would like to see a complete version of this.",
